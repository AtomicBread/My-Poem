Largemouth Bass
Wont ever touch grass.
Revs up the gas.
Smells like ass,
'cause it's a largemouth bass.

Bluegill
Some have frills.
And they bring out the till.
While I get the grill,
to sear a little Bluegill.

Walleye
I don't have any lye.
For deseart I want pie.
Don't put in any rye.
'Cause i'm allergic.

....

....

To the Walleye.

Rainbow Trout
You're looking a little stout.
Make sure to not pout.
Cause Mama'll make sure to shout,
and call you a Rainbow Trout.

Catfish
There's alaways a scurmish.
And you're open to make a wish.
So bring a big big dish,
for the delicious Catfish.

Alligator Gar
Don't bring the tar.
The cops steakout the bar.
And they're are right on par,
with the Alligator Gar.

Bighead Carp
Gonna bring out my harp.
Put it on the tarp.
Make sure its not sharp,
for the Bighead Garp.
